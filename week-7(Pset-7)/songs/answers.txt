Summary of Audio aura characterization:

For a listener's top 100 songs from 2018, the calculated "Audio Audra" is as follows:

Energy      : 0.65906  -> This suggests the liner enojoys music with a lively and upbeat nature.
Valence     : 0.484443 -> The mood of the music is fairly balanced, with neither strong positivity nor negativity.
Danceability: 0.71646  -> The liner favors songs that are quite suitable for dancing, indicating a preference for rhythmic and energetic tracks.

Limitations:

1. Scope of Data        :  Relying on just the top 100 songs may not fully capture the listener's broader musical tastes or less frequently played favorites.
2. Contextual Factors   :  The analysis doesn’t account for the context in which songs are listened to, such as whether they’re for relaxation, workouts, or social events.
3. Variability Over Time:  Music preferences can change throughout the year, and the top 100 songs might not reflect shifts in mood or genre preference.

Improved Approaches:

1. Broader Dataset     :   Use a larger sample of songs beyond the top 100 to capture a more comprehensive picture of the listener’s preferences.
2. Contextual Insights :   Incorporate data about listening contexts, such as playlists or times of day, to better understand the mood and energy associated with different scenarios.
3. Frequency Weighting :   Adjust the aura calculation to give more weight to frequently listened-to songs, reflecting the listener’s more consistent preferences.
4. Temporal Analysis   :   Examine changes in audio aura over different periods of the year to identify evolving musical tastes and mood shifts.

The Query I used to view the acquired data was:

SELECT
    AVG(energy) AS average_energy,
    AVG(valence) AS average_valence,
    AVG(danceability) AS average_danceability
FROM songs
LIMIT 100; -- Ensure we're only considering the top 100 songs.
